# Project Name

Everett's Weekend React Gallery
## Duration

2 weeks!

## Description

A project that displays pictures from a gallery. The gallery includes images that I uploaded. They are displayed in a grid, on cards. The images can be liked, and when moused over, they display a description of the image!

The biggest problem I had was the hover/mouse over to display the description. This was mostly my fault just because I could have made a button to display the description. I guess I just wanted to go a little bit further on the functionality. I also ran into a problem with the updating likes, but I just had a colon in the wrong place.
